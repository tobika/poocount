# poocount

Poocount is an app that keeps track of your bowel movements. You can easily add new entries and see a chart of all your bowel movements over time. (All the data stays on your device so you keep control over them)

The app is available on the play store:

The development is still in the beginning. If you have bugs or feature requests don't hesitate to share them with me.

The main development framework is Ionic.
